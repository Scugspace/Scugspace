- I'm Scug, I'm autistic [ðŸ˜­] I have a large interest in both Forsaken and Rainworld. 
- I love talking about headcanons. I may sometimes go overboard with characterization + general hcs, if you are someone who isn't a fan of such things, block me and move on.
- I use sometimes use tonetags to indicate what tone I'm using, and would prefer if those I intereact with also do since it helps me a lot.
-  I have a lot of freetime, which I spend with friends and playing video games. 
-  !If I'm your friend, please, PLEASE let me know If someting I say or do makes you uncomfortable. It's a major worry of mine that everyone dislikes me and finds me annoying.! I often don't realize I'm doing something wrong, I NEVER have weird intentions I promise.
-  My apoloch if this all in't accurate, I don't know how to write about myself. 

 [Intrests] 
- Forsaken, I am not good at the game, although it is very fun with friends. I like some of the characters. 
- Rainworld, I don't know why but I have over 2k hours in this game, the lore and gameplay make me very happy, rainworld is my favorite game of all time. Feel free to talk to me about it! My favorite slugcat is Monk. 
- WoF, I have reread this series many times, it holds a special place in my heart! Choosing a favorite character is difficult. I love Blue and Starflight tons. 
- Cats, all cats. Except breeds like munchkin cats.
- Bluudud, Bluudud is a character that I love with all of my heart. Please talk to me about him if you like him too, I spend a lot of time thinking about him and his mother, not in a weird way of course! He makes me very happy. 
- The interitance cycle. I recently finished reading this series after my dad recommended it to me. 
- Dragons
- NON FORSAKEN c00lkidd and 07, the other 07s too. This goes for more characterized versions of them, AND what the actual accounts did in the past! I am doing my very best to learn as much as I can about them after discovering interest through Forsaken. 
- HTTYD, loose interest that I have loved for years. Rusty on the lore, my favorite dragon is stormfly.
- I really like to think about how things work in concept, and/or biologically. For both real world things and fantasy, I'm sorry if I seem like I need a reason fir everything, it bothers me if I don't.
- I love drakobloxxers! All of them. My favorite are the water ones, I'd love to hear other's personal ideas on these guys too! 
  
[Social] 
- I'm socially anxious, I usually am not very open to new people, both in text chat [sometimes] and voice chats. I am self concious about my voice. At times I may not want to talk at all, if I'm ignoring you, especially if I don't know you much, please just leave me alone.
- I will be more social at times, my mood tends to change a lot, some days I'm very easily overwhelmed, others I'm not. 
- Systems please don't int or iwec, personal reasons.
- Don't bring up gore involving the stomach region [mainly intestines], tendons, muscles, or severe neck injury. This includes saying things like "gutted" to describe anything, for example, "x character is so gutted after recent changes".
- Please dont use racial slurs around me I don't care if you can reclaim them, I don't like it.
- A lot of random things make me angry. please remember this if I "get mad over nothing".
