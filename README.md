- I'm Scug, I have a large interest in both Phighting and Rainworld. 
- I love talking about headcanons.
- I use tonetags to indicate what tone I'm using, and would prefer if those I intereact with also do since it helps me a lot.
-  In my freetime I like to play games, watch Youtube, draw, and more.
-  I often have a lot of time on my hands, I like to play with my best friends!
-  !If I'm your friend, please, PLEASE let me know If someting I say or do makes you uncomfortable. It's a major worry of mine that everyone dislikes me and finds me annoying.!

 [Intrests] 
- Deltarune/undertale
- Phighting
- Rainworld
- WoF [for the dragons and first series only.]
- Avatar, the one with the like.. Blue people LOL
- Young subspace, hes my favorite phighting character.
- Young rocket.
- The interitance cycle, big one right now but fans are extinct.
  
[Social] 
- I'm socially anxious, causing me to not be that open to new people, at times I may not want to talk at all, if I'm ignoring you, please just leave me alone.
- I may be more social at times, my mood tends to change a lot.
- Systems please iwc, personal reasons.
- Don't interact with me if you ship romatic subspace, vinespace is thin ice though. It makes me VERY uncomfortable to see a character that I love [/p] in romantic ships, ESPECIALLY if it is subkit, brokerspace, or coilspace. Platonic is fine with a *few* characters, but still thin ice.
- Don't frequently talk about ships around me if it involves a character I am attached to.
- Most of my headcanons/AUs for subspace are extremely personal to myself, please dont directly take ideas, unless an extremely close friend, but even then please just ask.
 [Inspo is always ok]
- Please dont use racial slurs around me I don't care if "you're allowed to" I just don't like it.
- a lot of things randomly make me angry. please remember this if I "get mad over nothing".
- Don't make overly sexual remarks OR jokes at me, or about my characters. It's weird, I am a minor.
