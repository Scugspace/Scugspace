- I'm Scug, I have a large interest in both Forsaken and Rainworld. 
- I love talking about headcanons.
- I use tonetags to indicate what tone I'm using, and would prefer if those I intereact with also do since it helps me a lot.
-  In my freetime I like to play games, watch Youtube, draw, and more.
-  I often have a lot of time on my hands, I like to play with my best friends!
-  !If I'm your friend, please, PLEASE let me know If someting I say or do makes you uncomfortable. It's a major worry of mine that everyone dislikes me and finds me annoying.!

[Social] 
- I'm socially anxious, causing me to not be that open to new people, at times I may not want to talk at all, if I'm ignoring you, please just leave me alone.
- I will be more social at times, my mood tends to change a lot.
- Systems please don't int or iwec, personal reasons.
- Don't bring up gore involving the stomach region [mainly intestines], tendons, muscles, or severe neck injury. This includes saying things like "gutted".
- Please dont use racial slurs around me I don't care if you can reclaim them, I don't like it.
- A lot of random things make me angry. please remember this if I "get mad over nothing".
- Don't make overly sexual remarks OR jokes at me, or about my characters. It's weird, I am a minor.
