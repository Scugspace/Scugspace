- I'm Scug, I have a big interest in both Phighting and Rainworld. I may repeat myself/sound weird at times, however I'm trying to stop being so repetitive. Most of what I say is a joke, I often use tonetags to indicate what tone I'm using, and would prefer if those I intereact with also do since it helps me a lot! You will usually see me in the phighting corner with a friend or two. I'm socially anxious, not too open with new people, I can also be quiet sensitive. I may not know how to respond to things that well, so please iwc! In my freetime I like to play games, watch Youtube, SOMETIMES draw, and more. I often have a lot of time on my hands, I like to play with my friends. Please, PLEASE let me know If someting I say or do makes you uncomfortable. It's a major worry of mine that everyone dislikes me and finds me annoying.
