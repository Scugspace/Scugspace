- I'm Scug, I have a large interest in both Phighting and Rainworld. I may repeat myself/sound weird at times, however I'm trying to stop being so repetitive. Most of what I say is a joke, and I also find it fun to jokingly act as a character.
- I use tonetags to indicate what tone I'm using, and would prefer if those I intereact with also do since it helps me a lot!
-  In my freetime I like to play games, watch Youtube, SOMETIMES draw, and more.
-  I often have a lot of time on my hands, I like to play with my friends.
-  !Please, PLEASE let me know If someting I say or do makes you uncomfortable. It's a major worry of mine that everyone dislikes me and finds me annoying.!


[FOR PONYTOWN] 
- You will usually see me in the phighting corner with a friend or two. I'm socially anxious, causing me to not be that open to new people, at times I may not want to talk at all. I don't really know exactly how to respond to positive comments/compliments, whcih is why I usually don't respond at all to them.
- I'm not very comfortable with C + H from strangers, as it gives me a strong urge to move away and just feels weird in general. But it's always welcome for friends!
