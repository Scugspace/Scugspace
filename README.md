- I'm Scug, I have a large interest in both Phighting and Rainworld. I may repeat myself/sound weird, however I'm trying to stop being so repetitive. Most of what I say is a joke, and I also find it fun to jokingly act as a character at times.
- I love talking about headcanons...
- I use tonetags to indicate what tone I'm using, and would prefer if those I intereact with also do since it helps me a lot!
-  In my freetime I like to play games, watch Youtube, draw, and more.
-  I often have a lot of time on my hands, I like to play with my friends.
-  Please dont use racial slurs around me I don't care if "you're allowed to" I just don't like it.
-  !If I'm your friend, please, PLEASE let me know If someting I say or do makes you uncomfortable. It's a major worry of mine that everyone dislikes me and finds me annoying.!

 [Intrests] 
- Deltarune/undertale
- Phighting
- Rainworld
- warriors
- WoF [kind of, I just like the dragons and the first series.]
- Avatar, the one with the like.. Blue people LOL
  
[FOR PONYTOWN] 
- You will usually see me in the phighting corner with a friend or two. I'm socially anxious, causing me to not be that open to new people, at times I may not want to talk at all. I don't really know exactly how to respond to positive comments/compliments, whcih is why I usually don't respond at all to them.
- I'm not very comfortable with C + H from strangers, as it gives me a strong urge to move away and just feels weird in general. But it's always welcome for friends!
- Please don't cover me unless I cover myself or you're an extremely close friend, it's annoying. I genuinely dislike people who purpousfully cover randoms.
- I don't care if you take inspo or copy something from my skins, it's a completely normal thing to do in many forms of art.
- Systems please iwc, personal reasons.
